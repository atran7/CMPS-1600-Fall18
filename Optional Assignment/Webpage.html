<div style="font-family:MS Sans Serif">
    <p >A few things about myself is that I am a student at <strong><span style="color:red">Tulane</span></strong> University. I am originally from the Bay Area in California,
        and personally, I believe that NorCal is better than SoCal. As much as I love Cali, I wanted something new, which is
    why I decided to pack up my things and move to New Orleans for college. Things have definitely been different here
    compared to home</p>

    <p>I really like traveling, and every year, my family likes to go on a big family vacation, but lately, it's always been
    to Asia. As much as I love Asia, again, I want to see something new every once in a while, and things in Asia have all been
    pretty much the same. People and cultures are pretty homogenous there.</p>

    <p>Some things I like to do include: </p>

        <li>Sewing</li>
        <li>Baking</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo9Hc0QbjV0">Polymer Clay</a></li>
        <li>Traveling</li>
